To ensure a common, consistent development environment few docker images were created to run all the packages required from the *Maila* project.

## Table of Content

[TOC]

## Docker images

This repository contain the definition of the following Docker images:

  * ***maila-base*** image containing of the core module avoiding heavy visual tool application and physics simulator
  * ***mailla-dev*** image containing the complete set of tools needed to develop application within the Maila project

## Requirements

  1. [Install Docker](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-gazebo/blob/ign-gazebo4/docker/README.md#Install-Docker)

## Working with docker images

**Build the images:** *Note: Please be sure to have enough disk space left. Building this image needs around 2GB of free space. The successfully built image has a size of 2GB*

```sh
make build_maila_base  # build only maila-base img
make build_maila_dev  # build only maila-dev img
make build  # build both
```

**Pushing images on dockerhub:**

  * Log into the Docker Hub from the command line

    ```sh
    docker login --username=yourhubusername
    ```

  * Push the images on dockerhub

    ```sh
    make push_maila_base  # push only maila-base img
    make push_maila_dev  # push only maila-dev img
    make push  # push both
    ```

**Pulling images from dockerhub:**

```sh
make pull_maila_base  # pull only maila-base img
make pull_maila_dev  # pull only maila-dev img
make pull  # pull both
```

**Run the containers:**

```sh
make run_maila_base # run the maila base image
make run_maila_deb  # run the maila dev image
```

**Connect to running containers:**

```sh
make connect
```

## Simple ROS2 working example

In order to check if the maila-dev container is working properly you could try to run the following code. If you are able to control the turtle with your keyboard the system is working properly.

``` bash
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash # source ros environment
printenv | grep -i ROS # list the ROS env variables
apt update
apt install ros-foxy-turtlesim # install the demo
ros2 pkg executables turtlesim # list the executables
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
```

## Appendix

### Install docker

Install and configure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) for your operating system.

#### Linux

Docker has two available versions: Community Edition (CE) and  Enterprise Edition (EE). In this tutorial, we'll install the CE version.

   1. Remove old versions of Docker (if installed):

      ```sh
      sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io
      ```

   2. Install dependencies and keys.

      ```sh
       sudo apt install curl apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

       # Add the official GPG key of Docker
       curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
      ```

   3. Setup Docker using 1 of the two options below.

       1. Ubuntu Bionic users

          ```sh
           sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) edge"
          ```

       2. Everyone else.

          ```sh
           sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs)  stable"
          ```

   4. Install Docker

      ```sh
       sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install docker-ce
      ```

   5. Check your Docker installation:

      ```sh
       sudo docker run hello-world
      ```

   6. You should see the message `Hello from Docker!` confirming that your installation was successfully completed.

#### Windows

   1. Install [Docker Desktop for Windows/Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
   2. Right-click on the Docker task bar item, select **Settings/Preferences** and update **Resources > File Sharing** with any locations your source code is kept. See [tips and tricks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/troubleshooting#_container-tips) for troubleshooting.
   3. If you are using WSL 2 on Windows, to enable the [Windows WSL 2 back-end](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/docker-wsl2): Right-click on the Docker taskbar item and select **Settings**. Check **Use the WSL 2 based engine** and verify your distribution is enabled under **Resources > WSL Integration**.
